### Why Django version and not Django version >= 3?
An excellent question. The reason I created this app in version 1 was that I initially learned it for that version this summer. 
Moving to version 3.0 while learning Django in version 1.11 was a daunting task, so to test my knowledge, 
I created this website in the older version.

### Will I update it to Django version >= 3?
I am uncertain if I will update this app to version 3.0. I do have few updates in mind for this website, such as options window for customization, and due to university, I may not enough time.

Nonetheless, this may be the last app I will work on that supports Django version 1.11. In the near future, I will be releasing a Social Media website for Django 3.0 with much greater features and customization.

thank you,
